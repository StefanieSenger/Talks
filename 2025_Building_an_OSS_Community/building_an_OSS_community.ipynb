    "This talk explores what it takes to build and maintain sustainable open source communities, using scikit-learn to illustrate successes and lessons. It raises awareness of the challenges and complexities in contributor expectations, community building, volunteer burnout, governance tensions, and company involvement. Key issues are discussed to highlight what is needed for long-term health in OSS ecosystems."
