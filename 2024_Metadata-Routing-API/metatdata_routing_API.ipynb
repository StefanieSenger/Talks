    "### Abstract\n",
    "This talk will introduce scikit-learn users to the new API for <b>metadata routing</b>, a feature introduced in the recent releases and almost fully available since version 1.5 (released in May 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore what metadata is, how it can be used in machine learning pipelines, and how the new API simplifies routing metadata throughout a workflow. Routing metadata refers to an internal mechanism to pass metadata around between components of a data science pipeline, ensuring it reaches the functions that consume or utilize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using well-known metadata such as `sample_weight` and `groups` which are implemented in many scikit-learn metrics and evaluation tools, we will examine the restrictions for passing metadata prior to the introduction of the new API. Then, we will enable the new routing API and demonstrate how it solves these challenges with examples that involve layers of nested-ness through cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, or pipelines. We will explain the core components of the API, including methods like `set_fit_request()` and how to actually pass our metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attendees will leave with an understanding of how to enable and use the new routing API including passing metadata through Pipeline objects and validation tools like `cross_validate`. Additional references to the metadata user guide and developer guide will be provided for those interested in further exploration."

    "### 1. What is Metadata Routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- definition of metadata:\n",
    "    - metadata can be any data, that we want to apply on top of our tabular data, without it necessarily being part of it\n",
    "    - alternative: metadata is any data, that some function in a data science \"pipeline/process\" handles besides from X and y; it's a param that influences this function's treatment of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- examples for metadata:\n",
    "    - you might know from scikit-learn: `sample_weight` and `groups`\n",
    "    - but other libraries offer support for other kinds of metadata\n",
    "    - (slide only: graphically show some other examples of metadata: gender, race, sex, zipcode, .... and area/library it is used in)\n",
    "    - self defined metadata to be used in custom metrics (and possibly custom estimators)\n",
    "\n",
    "- use cases for metadata:\n",
    "    - fairness related use case\n",
    "    - business logic\n",
    "    - `sample_weight` and can be used to re-balance data and `groups` prevent data leakage in a cross validation\n",
    "    - note: we don't have better results if we pass metadata in terms of a better score, but we will have a more realistic model\n",
    "\n",
    "- definition of routing:\n",
    "    - routing just means that we pass metadata around between several components involved in a data science pipeline to where the metadata is used or consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "- prior to metadata routing API:\n",
    "    - we were restricted to only use `sample_weight` only within the metrics that would define it\n",
    "    - we could not consistently use it in a more nested structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- with metadata routing API:\n",
    "    - we can pass `sample_weight` and `groups` through several levels of nested-ness between the components of a data science pipeline\n",
    "    - we can combine objects from other libraries with scikit-learn estimators while still passing their metadata\n",
    "    - we can define our own custom metrics using self defined metadata\n"
