    "\n",
    "- definition of metadata:\n",
    "    - metadata can be any data, that we want to apply on top of our tabular data, without it necessarily being part of it\n",
    "    - alternative: metadata is any data, that some object or function in a data science \"pipeline/process\" handles besides from X and y; it's a param that influences this \"step's\" treatment of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "- examples for metadata:\n",
    "    - classical examples you might know from scikit-learn: sample_weight and groups\n",
    "    - but other libraries offer support for other kinds of metadata\n",
    "    - (graphically show some other examples of metadata: gender, race, sex, zipcode, .... and area/library it is used in)\n",
    "    - self defined metadata to be used in custom metrics (and possibly custom estimators)\n",
    "\n",
    "- use cases for metadata:\n",
    "    - sample_weight and groups can be used to balance data out and prevent data leakage\n",
    "    - fairness related use case\n",
    "    - business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "- definition of routing:\n",
    "    - routing just means that we pass metadata around (or through uninvolved steps) in a data science pipeline/process to where it is used/consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "- before metadata routing API:\n",
    "    - we were limited to where sample_weight was defined because it was the only param defined in the metrics (other than y_true and y_pred)\n",
    "    - we could not consistently use it if we were using the metric in a larger structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- with metadata routing API:\n",
    "    - we can pass sample_weight and groups through several levels of estimators and pipes in scikit-learn\n",
    "    - we can combine objects from other libraries with scikit-learn estimators while still passing their metadata\n",
    "    - we can define our own custom metrics using self defined metadata (as we will see in the next part)\n"

    "    - groups correspond to hospital (we suspect that each hospitalâ€™s data may have systematic biases due to factors like medical devices, policies, socioeconomic status of the patients, ...)\n",
    "    - sample_weight encodes zip-code or race of the patient\n",
    "    - we are interested in a fair model to determine a recommendation for a treatment among several options (classification problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - sample_weights either given by experts\n",

    "- slitter splits CV and is mainly interested in groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- set stage for TunedThresholdClassifier:\n",
    "    - TunedThresholdClassifier scales threshold for metrics and with metadata routing we can define our own scoring metrics that also consume metadata (https://scikit-learn.org/dev/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cost_sensitive_learning.html#cost-sensitive-learning-when-gains-and-costs-are-not-constant)"
