    "\n",
    "In this talk, we'll explore what it needs to start contributing to open source projects as a beginner. We'll discuss the mindset required for successful participation, focusing on qualities like collaboration, curiosity, and a willingness to learn. We'll cover essential pre-requisites such as understanding version control systems, issue tracking, and the basics of code review. Finally, we'll provide practical advice on where to begin your open source journey, including tips for finding beginner-friendly projects and issues and leveraging online resources and communities. If you're looking to take your first steps into the world of open source contribution, don't miss out on this."
